# Machine Learning with Python (Web Demo)This project demonstrates basic machine learning concepts inspired by Python's Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and introductory NLP, implemented in a modern, gold-themed web page using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No terminal or installation required—just open the HTML file in your browser.## Features- **Supervised and unsupervised modeling**: Simulated with interactive forms and logic inspired by classic ML workflows.- **Regression, classification, and sentiment analysis**: Each section provides a hands-on demo of a typical ML task.- **Modern, responsive design**: Gold color palette and user-friendly interface.## Included Projects- **Email Classifier (Spam vs No Spam)**: Enter an email and the simulated model will classify it as spam or not spam.- **House Price Prediction**: Simulate price prediction using basic features (rooms, area, age).- **Sentiment Detection**: Enter a comment or tweet and detect its sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).## How to use this project?1. Download or clone the repository.2. Open `ml_index.html` in your browser.3. Interact with the tools directly—no setup or terminal needed.## File Structure- `ml_index.html`: Main HTML file with the interface.- `ml_styles.css`: Modern gold styles for a clean look.- `ml_app.js`: All interactive logic and simulation code.## CustomizationYou can easily add more ML demos, change styles, or expand the logic by editing the JavaScript and CSS files. You can also adapt the logic to use more advanced models or datasets.---Perfect for learning, teaching, and demonstrating machine learning concepts in a web environment—no Python installation required!
